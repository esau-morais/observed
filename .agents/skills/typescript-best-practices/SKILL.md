# TypeScript practices

Read the implementation and existing types before adding a model.

1. Accept external payloads as unknown. Parse once into a named domain type. Infer types from the existing runtime schema when available.
2. Represent exclusive states with a shared kind discriminant. Handle every variant. Keep distinct failures when recovery differs.
3. Use satisfies for authored configuration and as const for literal inference. Neither validates external data.
4. Avoid assertions that conceal missing validation. Allow a narrow assertion only where its claim is established and TypeScript cannot express it. Isolate it at the boundary. Do not use as unknown as T or unchecked non-null assertions to escape model problems.
5. Brand IDs when interchange would produce plausible but wrong evidence. Prefer object arguments when positional values are easy to swap. Keep ordinary primitives elsewhere.
6. Use the simplest total signature. Return explicit absence or require validated non-empty input where needed. A non-empty array does not make every numeric index safe.
7. Validate numeric constraints. A number can be negative, non-finite, or outside the meaningful range.
8. Reuse generated or schema-derived types instead of duplicating provider shapes. Validate consumed fields and decide unknown-field handling per contract.
9. Separate expected failures from programming errors. Keep structured context sufficient to locate a run without logging secrets. Keep CLI machine output free of diagnostic chatter.
